# venom-phylogenetics
This paper combines genomics and phylogenetics to compare various snake venom mRNA sequences. I wrote this paper as part of a semester-long project for a "Principles of Bioinformatics" course (Fall 2022) at GWSPH. I received a 100% score on this paper.

For this project, I collected 111 snake venom mRNA sequences from 9 species of venemous snakes in Bangladesh, stored on an online database named [ISOB](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25848172/). I performed a multiple sequence alignment, visualized highly conserved regions, found the best-fit model of evolution, and ultimately used this information to generate a phylogenetic tree of the sequence. This tree is informative in developing polyvalent antivenoms, able to mitigate the effects of envenomation from various types of snakes. 

The mRNA sequences I collected are stored as `VenomSeqs.fasta`.

My full writeup for this project is stored as `Final Research Project_Varun Subramaniam`.
